# madlibs
Final project from The Iron Yard JS course

Your final project is to write a function that, when called, returns a Mad Libs string. Your function has to satisfy a few requirements:

1. The function should have 4 parameters: people, verbs, phrases, and nouns.

2. The parameters should each be arrays.

3. The return value from the function should be a concatenated string containing random elements from each argument.

4. If you call the program multiple times, it should return a different, random sentence each time.

5. The function should be named madlibs
